# Variables In Java

## What are Variables ?

Variables is a way to store information in our computer. Variables that we define in a program can be accessed by name we give them and computer find that variable inside RAM(Random Access Memory)

- As Name Suggest Variables can be changed i.e content of variables can be changed.

- There are different type of data we can define and collectively known as **Data types** in Java.

## How to define a Variable ?

To define a Variable we need to specify the data type and name of the variable.

```java
package code;

public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //declared an int type variable
        int num ;
        // initialized num variable and stored 10 in it
        num = 10;
        System.out.println(num);
    }
}
```

**Declaration Statement** used to define a variable and set the data type

**Initialization** is used to set value to the variable.
