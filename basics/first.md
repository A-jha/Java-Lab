- Java Program Have Keywords. Each keyword has specific Meanings and sometimes they need to be used in specific order.

- We write java program by following a specific set of syntax, using a combination of these keyword and they are collectively known as java program.

- **Note:** Keywords are case Sensitive, public and Public and even PUBLIC are different things

- public and class are two keywords - they have specific meaning which we will learn in later page

- The **public** java Keyword is an access Modifier. An access Modifier allows us to define the scope or How other of your code or even some else's code can access this code.

- public access modifier gives use full access to use that class.

- The **class** keyword is used to define a class. class Naming Should start in Uppercase Letter. Left and Right curly braces is used to define the logic inside the class.

- To define a class requires optional access modifiers, followed by class, followed by left and right curly braces.

- static and void are Keyword needed to run the code and we will learn more about them later.
